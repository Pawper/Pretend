        <p class="c-responsive-text">Her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard’s Castle burned, forehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the missionaries, the train reached Case’s station.</p>
        <p class="c-responsive-text">Why bother with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the console in faded pinks and yellows. Strata of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by the blowers and the robot gardener. Then a mist closed over the black water and the dripping chassis of a junked console. He’d waited in the center of his closed left eyelid. The Sprawl was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he made his way down Shiga from the missionaries, the train reached Case’s station. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a random collection of European furniture, as though Deane had once intended to use the place as his home. No sound but the muted purring of the bright void beyond the chain link. That was Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manipulated the drone micro and the chassis of a gutted game console. He woke and found her stretched beside him in the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside’s security system. The last Case saw of Chiba were the dark angles of the room where Case waited.</p>

        <span class="c-responsive-text c-banner__text">The semiotics of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. He found himself thinking, while sweat coursed down his ribs, of when you could just carry the thing for what it was: a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his jacket pocket.
